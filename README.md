## About
The work carried out in weeks 10 of the module Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is presented here.
 The work comes in the form of 4 walkthroughs that are intended to introduce the
foundational skills to administer Windows environments using PowerShell. In walkthrough 1
instruction is given on how to install PowerShell v7.3 side-by-side with PowerShell v5.1. The scripts required to carry out this task are stored in this repository. Walkthrough 2 builds upon
knowledge gained whilst learning Python earlier in the module, introducing variables, assignment operators
and flow control in PowerShell. Again, the scripts created are presented in the repository. In walkthrough 3, tuition is provided on carrying out remote server
administration using PowerShell scripts. Finally, in walkthrough 4 we are introduced to the set of
PowerShell features known as Desired State Configuration (DSC) used to create and maintain
configured Windows environments.
#### Branching
The repository has three main branches (Main, Test and Dev). Each Feature or Bugfix change will originate on its own branch created from the Dev branch and will be merged back into Dev when completed.  The Dev branch is then merged into the Test branch for extensive testing.  Once testing has been passed the test branch is then merged into the main branch. Finally, the Feature or Bugfix branch once full merged back into main, can be deleted.
## Getting-Started
All Scripts can be run on Visual Studio Code or appropriate IDE.

## Prerequisites
- Language: PowerShell 7.3 & 5.1
- Visual Studio Code version 1.7.1.2
- PowerShell Extension for Visual Studio Code.
- OS: Windows or Linux.

## Testing
Successful completion of all exercises in the PowerShell walkthroughs serves as sufficient testing of their suitability.
