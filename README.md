## About
The the work carried out in weeks 10 of the module Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is presented here.
 The work comes in the form of 4 walkthroughs that are intended to introduce the
foundational skills to administer Windows environments using PowerShell. In walkthrough 1
instruction is given on how to install PowerShell v7.3 side-by-side with PowerShell v5.1. The scripts required to carry out this task are stored in this repository. Walkthrough 2 buils upon
knowledge gained whilst learning Python earlier in the module, introducing variables, assignment operators
and flow control in PowerShell. Again, the scripts created are presented in the repository. In walkthrough 3, tuition is provided on carrying out remote server
administration using PowerShell scripts. Finally, in walkthrough 4 we are introduced to the set of
PowerShell features known as Desired State Configuration (DSC) used to create and maintain
configured Windows environments.
